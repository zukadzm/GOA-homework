# 4) print("zuka")


# Write a script that shows how to break lines in Python.
# 5) print("If u need to breake lines, u can use , break func or just click delete and its break 1 line.")


#Python Comments

# Add comments to explain each line of a given script.
# 6) each line, u writing codes in each line.


#Write a script and use comments to explain a function's purpose.
# 7) print("Lets, explain whats def means in python, def u can create your own function like, find() and everything you want.")


#Add a block comment to describe the script's overall functionality.
# 8)print("Lets, explain whats def means in python, def u can create your own function like, find() and everything you want.")
# print("Lets, explain whats def means in python, def u can create your own function like, find() and everything you want.")


#Use comments to disable a part of the script and re-enable it.
# 9) print("Zuka") now script is turn off.


#Write a script with intentional errors and comment on why they occur.
# 10) num = zuka. this is error code.



#Python Variables


#Create and initialize multiple variables of different data types
# 11) num = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("Hello, World")


#Swap the values of two variables.
# 12) num1 = 12 23
#     num2 = 23 12


#Create a script that takes user input to assign values to variables.
# 13)name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(name)


#Write a script that uses both global and local variables.
# 14)name = "zuka"
# num = 14


#Demonstrate variable naming conventions in Python.
# 15)name = "zuka"
# age = 14
# live = "Georgia"



#Python Data Types


#create variables of types: integer, float, string, and boolean.
# 16)integer = 14
# floatt = 1.5
# string = "zuka"
# print(10 < 10)


#Write a script to convert between different data types.
# 17)string = "Hello ,World"
# intt = 15
# floatt = 4.3
# print(string,intt,floatt)


#Demonstrate the use of type() function to check variable types.
# 18)name = "zuka"
# age = 15
# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))



#Perform basic arithmetic operations on different data types.
# 19)num1 = 340
# num2 = 12397
# bowl = num1 + num2
# print(bowl)



#Write a script to compare different data types using relational operators.
# 20)name = 'zuka'
# print(type(name))
# age = 15
# print(type(age))

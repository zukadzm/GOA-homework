// Array Destructuring: Extract values from an array and assign them to variables in a single line of code.
// Object Destructuring: Unpack properties from objects into distinct variables with concise syntax.
// Renaming Variables: Rename variables while destructuring to provide clearer names for extracted values.
// Skipping Values: Skip over unwanted elements in an array or properties in an object during destructuring.
// Destructuring in Loops: Iterate over an array of objects and destructure each object's properties directly in the loop declaration.
// Combining Destructuring and Rest Syntax: Use both destructuring and rest syntax together for flexible assignments.
// Skipping Elements: Given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], extract only the first and last elements into variables, skipping the middle ones.
// Using Destructuring with Map and Filter: Write a function that filters an array of objects based on a condition and uses destructuring to access object properties within the filter function.
// Destructuring Arrays with Mixed Types: Given an array containing both primitive values and objects, extract properties from the objects using destructuring.

// Manual Destructuring Function Rules
// Function Name: manualDestructing
// Input Parameter: Accepts one parameter obj, which should be an object to be destructured.
// Output: Returns an array containing the values of the properties of the input object.
// Usage: Usable by passing an object as an argument.
// Execution: Extracts the values of the properties from the input object manually, without using any built-in destructuring syntax.
// Returned Array: Contains the values of the properties of the input object in the same order as they are defined in the object.
